# About Me
My name is Julia Frederick. I was born in Coral Springs, Florida and resided there until I began my BS in Biology at Georgia Tech in the Fall of 2012. During my time at Georgia Tech I was member of the Women's Track and Field team where I competed in high jump and javelin. After graduation I moved to Gaithersburg, Maryland to start work at the Vaccine Production Program Lab for the NIH, where I worked in Cell Culture. After 2 years of work, I decided to pursue graduate school and I am now working towards my PhD in Environmental Health Science at the University of Georgia

# Reseach Background

### Georgia Tech - [Dr. Jeannette Yen's Lab](http://www.yen.biology.gatech.edu/)
My research focused on the behavior of *Hesperodiaptomus shoshone* when exposed to hydrodynamic cues. This lab is considered a bio-inspired design lab, where our research is being applied to autonomous underwater vehicles. 

### NIH - [Vaccine Production Program Lab](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/marybeth-daucher-phd)
During my time here I worked on two projects with the goal of developing a vaccine to combat HIV. One was an antibody vaccine while the other was a recombinant protein. We created protocols to get the best yield from each bioreactor run and would transfer these protocol from our 3-50L scale to the production facility that operated at a scale of 1000-2000L.

# Current Research Interest:
#### University of Georgia - [Dr. Travis Glenn's Lab](https://baddna.uga.edu/)
My current research focuses on understanding the driving factors of the Lyme Disease Gradient. In this research I am doing a combination of behavior biology, population genetics, and Mendelian genetics. My species of interest is *Ixodes scapularis*.

# Training
##### Previous training courses I have taken:
  + JMP statistical software
  + GOWN (for working in GMP facilities)
  + Nature Masterclass in Writing
  + R bootcamp hosted by UGA school of Ecology
  + R Maymester computational course

# Previous Experience
To receive an undergraduate degree from Georgia Tech you must complete a computer coding course which was mainly taught in Python but exposed us to java, SCAD, and HTML. Through the trainings I have been a part of I have had exposure to JMP, and R. My JMP training focused on ANOVA, regression, and custom design of experiments. We then applied the training to my work at the NIH for experimental design and some data analysis when complete. The R trainings have covered a variety of topics but in general have given me a decent overview of all things R. I have been using R in my research for data visualization of my population genetics, and laying out the schematic for crossbreeding experiments.  

# Goals for this course
I this course I would like to leave with an understanding of the different data analyses that can be run through R. I would also like to have some example code I will be able to reference in the future when I begin data analysis of my own research. 

# **_Fun Fact_**

Last October I  adopted a dog through UGA's vet school from when the 3rd years are doing a spay and neuter lab. Her name is **Cora**, based off of the mother charater in Downton Abbey. She had Georgia's first confirmed case of Heartgard resistant Heartworm, and will be done with her treatment the week after Labor Day!
